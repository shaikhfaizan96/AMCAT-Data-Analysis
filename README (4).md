# Project Title: Analysis and Prediction of AMCAT Scores

## Objective:
- To analyze and predict the performance of candidates in the AMCAT test.
- To understand the relationship between different sections of the test (such as English, Quantitative, Logical Ability, etc.) and the overall score.
- To develop a machine learning model to predict candidate performance based on their historical data.
  
## Libraries Used:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting the distribution of scores.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification).
- Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.

## Plots and Visualizations:
- Histogram and KDE Plots: Display the distribution of individual section scores (e.g., Quantitative, English, Logical Ability).
- Boxplots: Show outliers and spread of scores across different sections.
- Pairplots: Visualize relationships between different sections of the AMCAT test to identify correlations.
- Heatmap (Correlation Matrix): Analyze the correlation between different test sections and overall performance.
- Bar Charts: Represent the mean scores for different sections across different candidate demographics (such as educational background or work experience).

## Analysis Performed:
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Investigated the distribution of scores across different sections.
- Identified outliers, missing values, and anomalies in the data.

## Correlation Analysis:
- Analyzed how different sections are related to the overall AMCAT score.
- Used heatmaps to show strong and weak correlations between variables.

## Feature Importance:
- Implemented feature selection techniques like RandomForestRegressor to understand which sections contribute the most to overall performance.

## Conclusion:
- The analysis revealed strong correlations between specific sections (e.g., Logical Ability and Quantitative sections) and the overall AMCAT score.
- The machine learning model achieved a high accuracy in predicting the overall score using the performance in individual sections.
- The insights from this analysis can be used to guide students in preparing more efficiently for AMCAT by focusing on the most impactful sections.
- The study shows that targeted improvements in weaker sections can significantly boost a candidateâ€™s overall AMCAT score, helping them in employability assessments.
